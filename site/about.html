    <h2>Hi! I'm</h2><h1>David Siqueira</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p> I'm a Brazilian designer and illustrator based in Porto, Portugal. Here's a short version of my career history.</p>

        <p> I'm working as a designer since 2006, with graphic design, diagraming books, designing posters, packages, stickers, and materials for supermarkets and stores, which led me to my second job, creating furniture, signs, interior decoration, and storefronts.</p> 

        <p> To make it easier for the clients to understand the projects, self-learning to represent my creations with photorealistic 3d models. </p> 

        <p> These 3d models took me to another job in the marketing team of a big software company in Brazil, designing their events booths, some of them award winners of best event boots. Being on this company, I started to help the developers with some insights for the UIs, creating icons and learned front end development, UI design, and user experience research methods changing again my design path to this area, that made me start many personal projects with friends on my free time, like mobile games, websites, and apps.</p> 

        <p> Together some of these friends I founded N4 my first company developing games, and apps for many clients. Everything was going well, but life is not always a bed of roses. Beign the designer, front end developer, administrator, hr of my company took me to some mistakes. After investing on a dream of having a giant product for the health sector during a big crisis in Brazil, I almost crashed my company, and I decided to close it and go to another country to learn more and experience a new culture.</p> 

        <p> In Portugal I started to work on a digital transformation consulting agency, helping many companies to develop digital solutions with the design thinking methodology. There I worked toghether with the Porto's Water deppartment to develop the new digital platform and app for clients improving the process and usability. Another breakthrough project was with a multinational corporate training company, to help to develop their paperless process with a new learning platform composed by 4 elements, a Backoffice platform to create the courses, a teacher's platform, a students area and a App to reinforce the learning process.
